# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

The fictional company DriverPass wanted to create software that would help people learning to drive pass their driver’s license exams. I enjoyed writing the business requirement document and creating the different UML diagrams to outline the system. However, I could have done a better job with the class diagram by adding methods to the classes.

The owner of DriverPass wanted the system to be accessible on every platform, so I designed the system to be web-based. This allows the system to be cross-platform. Another requirement was to make the system available online to multiple users. This required setting up a login procedure to differentiate users and storing their information in a database.

When designing software, it’s important to interview the client thoroughly and take detailed notes of their requirements. These requirements can be translated into the design documents and UML diagrams that outline the project, making it easier for developers to do their job.

In the future, I may research the designs of similar projects created by other companies. This could give me ideas for creating my own designs.
